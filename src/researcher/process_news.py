#     'description': 'The artist formerly known as Kanye West (he changed his name to ‚ÄúYe‚Äù legally in 2018) is, in addition to being a self-proclaimed ‚ÄúNazi,‚Äù now a denizen of the web3 world he once derided.\n\nOn Wednesday, West took to social media to announce YZY coin. ‚ÄúThe official Yeezy token just dropped,‚Äù said a bored-looking West in a video posted on his X account. Within hours, YZY had climbed to a market cap of some $3 billion, Wired reports. Not long afterward, the coin predictably plummeted in value and eventually settled around $1.5 billion, Forbes writes.\n\nWest also shared a link to a website with additional details about the new crypto asset, although it doesn‚Äôt provide much information. ‚ÄúYZY Money is a concept to put you in control, free from centralized authority,‚Äù it says, vaguely. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any sort of white paper or other explanatory note sharing how the asset works. Instead, the site includes a familiar disclaimer: ‚ÄúUsers acknowledge that digital assets involve inherent risks and potential for complete loss. Nothing on this site constitutes financial legal or investment advice.‚Äù The site‚Äôs terms and conditions page also appears to include the stipulation that users waive their right to participate in a class action lawsuit.\n\nWest once claimed that meme coins were not his thing. Wired notes that, in a since-deleted social post, West once said: ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT DOING A COIN,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúCOINS PREY ON THE FANS WITH HYPE.‚Äù\n\nThe rapper‚Äôs increasingly erratic and bizarre behavior has left many onlookers searching for an explanation. West, himself, has claimed he suffers from a number of mental illnesses, alleging‚Äîback in 2018‚Äîthat he was bi-polar. However, earlier this year, West claimed that, actually, he had been diagnosed with autism, and that the previous diagnosis was incorrect. All we really know is that, at one point, West was releasing killer singles like ‚ÄúGold Digger‚Äù and ‚ÄúStronger‚Äù and going on Ellen Degeneres and then, at some point, he was ranting about Jews, wearing the MAGA hat, showing up to interviews in outfits like this, and dating a woman whose dress code leaves little to the imagination.\n\nTo add to the astounding devolution, West declared earlier this year that he was a ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù and released a single online called ‚ÄúHeil Hitler.‚Äù Platforms scrambled to rid themselves of the song, but it persisted, popping up under various pseudonyms on YouTube and Spotify. West‚Äôs career has not recovered, so the shitcoin feels like a natural next step.\n\nGizmodo was unable to reach West for comment....',
